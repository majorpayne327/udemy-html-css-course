                <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags I have been learning to use.</p>
                <p>This is <span class="danger-text">another paragraph</span>, and U would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>

                <blockquote cite="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/Full-text-of-Martin-Luther-Kings-I-Have-a-Dream-Speech-221512211.html">
                    <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>

                    <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
